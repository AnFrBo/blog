# 1. Introduction <a class="anchor" id="introduction"></a>
Nowadays marketing practitioners face a multitude of challenges. 

In the first part of this analysis we will look at which challenges exist and how data analysis might be employed to tackle these problems.

In the second part we will look more closely on one specific problem and give a summary and an evaluation of proposed methods to solve that problem.
# 2. Common Marketing Challenges <a class="anchor" id="challenges"></a>
Some of the most commonly cited challenges we found were:
- Drive Traffic to the website
- Increase/Prove ROI of marketing campaigns
- Turn website visitors into buyers
- Reach people at the right time
- Target content to the right audience
- Select marketing channel/method

Since those challenges were all related to marketing activity we decided to focus on how data anlysis could be used to improve the performance of marketing activities. More specificly there are 3 questions with regards to marketing activity we focused on.
### When to start the marketing activity?
### Who to target?
### Which treatment should be used for which target?


# 3. Motivation for Multiple Treatments <a class="anchor" id="motivation"></a>
We decided to focus on multiple treatments for several reasons. Today there are many ways to reach your potential customers and picking the right one is crucial for succesfull marketing activity. Additionally, we found that there has not been much research on this topic and there is no comprehensive comparison of the research that does exist. Therefore, we decided to look at the models that have been proposed so far and compare them. Furthermore, we want to identify potential new directions for futher research.
